    <h1><u><b> Survey Description</b></u></h1>
    This survey explores various aspects of the fashion industry and individual perspectives on its influence. We delve into spending habits, focusing on how much people invest in fashion, and examine the role of trend-following behaviors in shaping personal style. Additionally, we seek opinions on more provocative topics, such as the inclusion of nudity in fashion trends, aiming to understand the diversity of views on its artistic and cultural impact.
