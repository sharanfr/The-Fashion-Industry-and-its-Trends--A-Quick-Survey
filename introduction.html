       <span style="font-size: 4rem; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> "Fashion"</span> is seen as a form of art by designers and who adore it and describes the thoughts of an individual and expresses them via the clothes. It gives him/her a freedom of expressing themselves to the world. "Don't be into trends. Don't make fashion own you, but decide what you are."- Gianni Versace sets an example of how fashion represents an individual's freedom and their thoughts. Fashion and style has set trends accross various time-periods and has had people change their fashion preferences and choose the one which they feel comfortable to wear. This survey serves as a social project, helping fashion-inspiring brands to design and also set trends based on the preferences.</p>
